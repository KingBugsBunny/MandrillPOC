# Mandrill Proof of Concept

This project was generated using Hottowel.

the changes I made to hottowel are in the package.json file I imported mandrill-api and then I added the necessary code
 in the route file as I am not completely sure how to write and serve my own route.
 
 I commented the code a little bit as well in the route file. 
 
 All data is output to the console and to the respective email address on the receive side.
